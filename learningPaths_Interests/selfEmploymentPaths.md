# Systems-Focused Self-Employment Options

Below are realistic self-employment paths that fit **systems engineering**, with what each option is and the core skills required.

---

## 1. Developer Tools (Best Overall Fit)

**What it is**
- Build tools used by developers and engineering teams.
- Usually CLI tools, libraries, or background utilities.

**Examples**
- Log analyzers
- Profilers
- Debugging helpers
- CI/build tools

**Skills needed**
- Python (tooling)
- C/C++ (performance-critical code)
- Linux fundamentals
- Debugging
- Reading existing code
- Clear documentation

---

## 2. Automation Consulting

**What it is**
- Solve internal engineering problems and remove manual work.
- Deliver scripts and tools, not long-term employment.

**Examples**
- Build/deploy automation
- Fix slow pipelines
- System cleanup and reliability work

**Skills needed**
- Python
- Shell scripting
- OS/process knowledge
- Performance analysis
- Systems debugging

---

## 3. Open Source + Paid Support

**What it is**
- Maintain an open-source systems tool.
- Companies pay for support, fixes, and features.

**Examples**
- Config validators
- Monitoring agents
- Infrastructure libraries

**Skills needed**
- Systems design
- Long-term maintenance
- Git discipline
- Debugging
- Documentation
- Python or C/C++

---

## 4. Security Research / Bug Bounties (Side Income)

**What it is**
- Find and report vulnerabilities.
- Paid per valid finding.

**Examples**
- Memory bugs
- Logic flaws
- Privilege escalation

**Skills needed**
- C/C++ memory model
- OS internals
- Debuggers
- Assembly reading
- Reverse engineering
- Python for tooling

---

## 5. Niche Internal Software

**What it is**
- Build boring but critical internal tools for businesses.

**Examples**
- Monitoring dashboards
- Data validation systems
- Configuration tools

**Skills needed**
- Systems thinking
- Python backend
- Data handling
- Error handling
- Reliability mindset

---

## 6. Performance Engineering (Advanced)

**What it is**
- Diagnose and fix slow or failing systems.

**Examples**
- CPU bottlenecks
- Memory leaks
- I/O issues

**Skills needed**
- OS internals
- Profiling tools
- C/C++ performance intuition
- Memory and cache behavior

---

## Core Skill Overlap

All options share:
- Python
- Linux
- Debugging
- Systems thinking
- Reading unfamiliar code
- Clear documentation

Specialization comes after the core is solid.
